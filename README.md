# About me
I graduated from *Jordan university of science and technology* with a bachelor degree in civil engineering in 2018 with an excellent grade, I worked as resident engineer on a small project but I did not find myself in this field, so I learned web development via free online courses but I hope to be proficient that why I am taking a course in software development - python at *LTUC-Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair School of Advanced Computing*.

# What I learned from the first class?

## GUI vs CLI
we learned the difference between **GUI**   (Graphical User Interface) and **CLI** (Command Line Interface), they both away to interact with the operating system, but the GUI is more visual and simpler to use and with the CLI you use the command to interact with the system but it preferred by programmer because you can multitask using the CLI like using 
`mkdir` command to create multiple directories with one line 

## Version control system (VCS)
VCS is used to track the changes in the code during development. **Git** is the most popular VCS and with the use of [GitHub](https://www.github.com) we can work with multiple people in the same software.

With both git and GitHub we can do:
- Collaboration 
- Backup and recovery
- Tracking changes
- Auditing 

## Markdown
and lastly, we learn about markdown which I use to write this file, it is a language used to format text, using  symbols and characters, and programmers mostly use it to write documentation
